/**
 * This version of the {@link TabuSearch} can create multiple threads to take advantage
 * of multiple processors. If more than one thread is requested, then the neighborhood
 * will be split up evenly after the {@link MoveManager#getAllMoves getAllMoves()} method is called
 * on your {@link MoveManager}.
 * <p/>
 * <em><b>This is the recommended {@link TabuSearch}</b></em> for nearly all well-threaded
 * applications because it does not block on the {@link #startSolving} method. When done
 * solving a given set of iterations, the thread will die, freeing up your computer's resources.
 * If you add iterations with {@link SingleThreadedTabuSearch#setIterationsToGo setIterationsToGo()} and call 
 * {@link #startSolving} again,
 * the thread(s) will restart.
